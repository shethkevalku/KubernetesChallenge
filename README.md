Challenge of Personio


This project aims to deploy a simple Golang application in a Kubernetes environment using various AWS services such as EKS, ECR, VPC, S3, and IAM. Infrastructure resources will be managed using Terraform as the infrastructure-as-code (IaC) provider. The CI/CD process will be handled using GitHub Actions.

**Deployment Approach:**
To achieve the desired deployment, the following steps will be followed:

**Infrastructure Provisioning:**

Create an S3 bucket and DynamoDB table to store the Terraform state files securely.
Configure the S3 backend to store the Terraform state files remotely for better collaboration and versioning.
VPC Setup:

Create a VPC (Virtual Private Cloud) along with its associated resources, such as subnets, internet gateway, and route table.
Ensure all VPC resources are appropriately tagged with "Project: Personio" for better resource management and identification.
EKS Cluster Deployment:

Deploy an EKS cluster to provide a managed Kubernetes environment.
For the testing environment, utilize a single worker node to keep it simple.

ECR Repository Creation:
Create an ECR repository using Terraform to store the Docker images built for the Golang application.
Kubernetes Deployment and Service:

Configure a Kubernetes deployment file to create two replicas of the Golang application.
Set up a Kubernetes service to expose the application, listening on port 80.
CI/CD Process:

To enable continuous integration and deployment (CI/CD), the following approach will be used:

GitHub Actions Workflow:
Create a GitHub Actions workflow that triggers on every push to the repository.
Configure the workflow to build the Docker image, push it to the ECR repository, and deploy the application to the EKS cluster.

**Files and Terraform Structre Explanation**
1. Create S3 and DynamoDB Buckets:

Comment out the lines in the **main.tf** file that call the VPC and EKS module.
Also, comment the lines related to the backend configuration.

2. Initialize Backend Configuration:
Once the S3 and DynamoDB buckets are created, uncomment the lines related to the backend configuration in **main.tf**.
Run **terraform init** to initialize the backend configuration.
Verify that the backend is successfully initialized.

3.Enable VPC and EKS Resources:
Uncomment the lines related to the VPC and EKS resources in **main.tf**.
Push the updated code to your repository.

4. Trigger the Pipeline:
This will trigger the pipeline configured in your CI/CD system, which will create all the required resources based on the updated code.

5. Deploy Kubernetes Resources:
Once the Kubernetes cluster is up and running, execute the following commands:
Copy code
**kubectl apply -f deployment.yaml
kubectl apply -f service.yaml**
This will deploy the Kubernetes deployment and service based on the provided YAML files.

6.Verify and Test Connectivity:
Verify that the deployment and service are successfully created by running kubectl get deployments and kubectl get services.
Test the connectivity to your application by accessing the service endpoint or using tools like curl or a web browser.




**Questions in challenge**

**Describe how you would rollback to a previously deployed version of the application**

 a) kubectl rollout history deployment sample-website
 b) kubectl rollout undo deploy sample-website --to-revision=2 

**Further Improvements:**

a) Increase Worker Node Group: Consider increasing the number of worker nodes in the node group to ensure high availability and better performance. Having at least two worker nodes provides redundancy and improves fault tolerance.

b) Enable Private Access for Cluster Endpoint: Enhance the security of the EKS cluster by enabling private access for the cluster endpoint. This ensures that communication with the cluster is restricted to the private network, reducing exposure to the public internet.

c) Implement Logging and Monitoring: Set up logging and monitoring for the EKS cluster and applications. Utilize services like Amazon CloudWatch or Prometheus to collect logs and metrics. Configure alarms and notifications to proactively identify and respond to any issues or anomalies.

d) Utilize Route53 for Domain Hosting: Use Amazon Route53 service to host a domain and route traffic to the service endpoint using a friendly domain name. This provides a more user-friendly experience and simplifies access to the application.

e) Implement Blue/Green Deployment: Adopt a separate blue/green deployment strategy to test new features or updates. Deploy the new version of the application in a separate environment (green), validate and test it thoroughly, and then switch traffic from the old (blue) environment to the new one seamlessly.

f) Establish Disaster Recovery (DR) Strategy: Set up a disaster recovery region to ensure business continuity in the event of a primary region failure. Regularly back up critical data and applications, and define recovery time objectives (RTO) and recovery point objectives (RPO) to minimize data loss and downtime.

g) Implement Cost Monitoring: Create budget alerts and regularly monitor the cost of the EKS cluster to avoid unexpected cost spikes. Set up alerts based on forecasted and actual metrics to gain insights into the cost trends and optimize resource allocation.

h) Enforce HTTPS: Use HTTPS instead of HTTP for secure communication between clients and the application. Obtain SSL/TLS certificates from a trusted certificate authority and configure the load balancer or ingress controller to terminate SSL/TLS connections.

i) Consider AWS ECS: If Kubernetes API is not explicitly required, evaluate the use of Amazon Elastic Container Service (ECS) as an alternative deployment option. ECS offers simplified management and cost advantages, and it may be a suitable choice depending on your application requirements.
